# Super Synth README

## Overview
Super Synth is a web-based synthesizer application that allows users to create, record, and share their musical compositions. It provides a user-friendly interface for composing music using virtual keyboard keys, offering various instruments like Sine, Square, Triangle, and Sawtooth waves. Users can interact with the synth by playing different notes, recording their performances, and sharing their creations with others.

## Features 
Interactive Keyboard: Play different notes on a virtual keyboard to produce sounds.
Instrument Selection: Choose between four types of waveforms (Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth) to shape your sound.
Recording Feature: Record your musical compositions in real-time.
Playback Controls: Play back recorded songs with a single click.

### How to Use
Upon launching Super Synth, you will see a virtual keyboard with keys corresponding to different musical notes. Select an instrument from the dropdown menu to change the waveform of the sound produced by the keyboard. Pressing a key will play the associated note, and holding down a key will sustain the note until released. The "Record" button allows you to start recording your performance, and pressing it again will stop the recording. You can then play back your recording with the "Play" button or save your recordings.
